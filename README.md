> Multiple processes accessing a shared resource concurrently

## Overview

This example starts a shared database and multiple processes.

The processes represent multiple users, or locations, or programs 
hitting a shared database at the same time. 

## Prerequisites

1. Git
1. Python 3.7+ (3.11+ preferred)
1. VS Code Editor
1. VS Code Extension: Python (by Microsoft)

## Task 1. Fork 

Fork this repository ("repo") into **your** GitHub account. 

## Task 2. Clone

Clone **your** new GitHub repo down to the Documents folder on your local machine. 

## Task 3. Explore

Explore your new project repo in VS Code on your local machine.

## Task 4. Execute Check Script

Execute 00_check_core.py to generate useful information.

## Task 5. Execute Multiple Processes Project Script

Execute multiple_processes.py.

Read the output. Read the code. 
Try to figure out what's going on. 

1. What libraries did we import? 
    a. datetime </br>
    b. logging  </br>
    c. multiprocessing </br> 
    d. os </br>
    e. platform </br>
    f. sqlite3 </br>
    g. sys </br>
    h. time </br>
2. Where do we set the TASK_DURATION_SECONDS?</br>
   After settingup basic configurations for login, declared the constant called TASK_DURATION_SECONDS at line 40.
3. How many functions are defined? </br>
   7 functions are defined.
4. What are the function names? </br>
   recreate_database,create_table,drop_table,insert_pet,process_one,process_two,process_three.
5. In general, what does each function do? </br>
recreate_database- It will drop if database exits and recreates. </br>
create_table - Creates table in database. </br>
drop_table- Drops table if exists. </br>
insert_pet - Insert data into the table i.e insert pet into pets table. </br>
process_one- defines P1, name and breed of the pet. </br>
process_two- defines P1, name and breed of the pet. </br>
process_three- defines P1, name and breed of the pet. </br>
6. Where does the execution begin? Hint: generally at the end of the file.</br>
Line 185</br>
 # start each process</br>
    p1.start()</br>
    p2.start()</br>
    p3.start()</br>
7. How many processes do we start? 3 (p1,p2,p3)
8. How many records does each process insert? each process inserts 2 records(3 process's each 2 reocrds).

In this first run, we start 3 processes, 
each inserting 2 records into a shared database 
(for a total of 6 records inserted.)

In each case, the process gets a connection to the database, 
and a cursor to execute SQL statements.
It inserts a record, and exits the database quickly.

In general, we're successful and six new records get inserted. 

## Task 6. Execute Multiple Processes Script with Longer Tasks

For the second run, modify the task duration to make each task take 3 seconds. 
Hint: Look for the TODO.
Run the script again. 
With the longer tasks, we now get into trouble - 
one process will have the database open and be working on it - 
then when another process tries to do the same, it can't and 
we end up with errors. 

## Task 7. Document Results After Each Run

To clear the terminal, in the terminal window, type clear and hit enter or return. 

`clear`

To document results, clear the terminal, run the script, and paste all of the terminal contents into the output file.

Use out0.txt to document the first run. 

Use out3.txt to document the second run.

## Helpful Information

To get more help on the early tasks, see [streaming-01-getting-started](https://github.com/denisecase/streaming-01-getting-started).

### Select All, Copy, Paste

On Windows the select all, copy, paste hotkeys are:

- CTRL a 
- CTRL c 
- CTRL v 

On a Mac the select all, copy, paste hotkeys are:

- Command a
- Command c
- Command v

Detailed copy/paste instructions (as needed)

1. To use these keys to transfer your output into a file, 
clear the terminal, run the script, then click in the terminal to make it active.
1. To select all terminal content, hold CTRL and the 'a' key together. 
1. To copy the selected content, hold CTRL and the 'c' key together. 
1. To paste, open the destination file (e.g. out0.py) for editing.
1. Click somewhere in the destination file to make it the active window.
1. Now hit CTRL a (both together) to select all of the destination file.
1. Hit CTRL v (both together) to paste the content from your clipboard.

and share them in our discussion.

### Reading Error Messages

Python has pretty helpful error messages. 
When you get an error, read them carefully. 

- What error do you get?

### Database Is Locked Error

Do a web search on the sqlite3 'database is locked' error.

- What do you learn? </br>
This error code occurs when the user tries to perform two inappropriate operations on a database at the same detail and on the same database connection. This error code shows that an operation canâ€™t be continued due to encounter with a transaction that uses the same database connection or the transaction that uses a distinct database connection by using a shared cache.</br>
Overall, this error occurs when we are trying to open the database which is already being used by someone.
- Once a process fails, it crashes the main process and everything stops. 

### Deadlock

Deadlock is a special kind of locking issue where a process 
is waiting on a resource or process, that is waiting also. 

Rather than crashing, a system in deadlock may wait indefinitely, 
with no process able to move forward and make progress.
