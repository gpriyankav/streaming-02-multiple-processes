This will clear the console output. 

Run the file once while the tasks are short.

SUCCESS: All processes successfully completed!

Now - increase the task duration (representing
      the time the task has the database
      tied up during an insert statement).
How well do multiple, concurrent processes share a database
    when each task takes more time?
How can multiple processes share a resource
    without interfering with each other?
